## NoSQL vs. SQL
1. The Scalability –
In almost all situations SQL databases are vertically scalable. But on the other hand NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. This means that you handle more traffic by sharding, or adding more servers in your NoSQL database. Less network communication overload.
2. NoSQL has dynamic schema
3. NoSQL is not a good fit for complex query

## XML vs. JSON

|                       | XML                  | JSON         |
|-----------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Verbosity/Complexity  | Harder               | Easier       |
| Validity              | DTD.. Widely used    | JSON Schema  |
| Programming Interface | Clunky               | Good         |
| Querying              | Strong. XPath XQuery | JSON Path... |

# 常见面试题
1. PRIMARY KEY / FOREIGN KEY
The *PRIMARY KEY* constraint uniquely identifies each record in a database table. (UNIQUE AND NON-NULL)
The *FOREIGN KEY* is a key used to link two tables together, 
it is a field in table A that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in table B.

2. JOIN
* (INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in *both tables*
* LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Return all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table, if not match, it will be filled with null
* RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Return all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
* FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Return all records when there is a match in either left or right table
