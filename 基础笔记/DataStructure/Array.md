Let n=7 and k=3

Original List                   : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
After reversing all numbers     :[7 6 5]4 3 2 1
After reversing first k numbers : 5 6 7[4 3 2 1]
After revering last n-k numbers : 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 --> Result

Suppose the first meet at step `k`, the distance between the start node of list and the start node of cycle is `s`, and the distance between the start node of cycle and the first meeting node is `m`. Then `2k = (s + m + n1r) = 2(s + m + n2r) ==> s + m = nr`. Steps moving from start node to the start of the cycle is just `s`, moving from m by `s` steps would be the start of the cycle, covering `n` cycles. In other words, they meet at the entry of cycle.
