1. Introduce yourself
    在本科时有对IOT有一定兴趣，后来在美国UMASS读了ECE专业，对CS有了更多的了解。第一份实习时关于前端的，后来加入了NIH 的eRA department, grant management system。日常工作包括front-end development for user experience和部分后端开发
    My name Yuchong, you can call me YC for short or Brandon. My bachelor degree is Electronics Science and Technology and I was interested in IoT. Then I came to US for my Master Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering to study more on Computer Science. I started learning web development skills in my internship. I currently worked in National Institutes of Health building grant management system. I am responsible for backend development and also front-end development by collaborating with UX team.

2. Why Amazon
   There are three reasons. I am very amazed by Amazon's products, say dot, echo, show speaker, they are literally all around our daily life which provides amazon services controlled by only users' voice. And all this great experience is built on the reliable, robust and scalable amazon system which I have great interest in and make contributions to it. Last but not least it's exciting to tackle challenging questions with software development engineer of exceptional technical expertise in Amazon.

3. Strength st
   Always curious on learning more. Say, I like trying different tech stack and getting to know new technology. ES10, Angular new feature.
   Quick learning skill. when I just join my current team, the team use the newest technologies in the whole Organization. The good side is other teams are jealious that we are building stuff as our manager said. But bad side is, sometimes I lack of help. I had to learn some latest not often used features in Angular without any knowledge transfer, because the last front-end developer became the UX team lead. 

4. Weakness
   Worrisome. I can be very worry and ask a lot questions in the early stage receiving a new requirement. It is very obvious to my teammates. Also, when deadline approaching, I can be very worry too. 
   Sale skills and public speaking.
